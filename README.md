# Crowd sourcing programming resouces for Stanford economists

This is a repo to crowdsource useful programming resources and to learn how to use GitHub in the process. If you want to add a link to the list, then please submit a pull request. You can also propose changes to how we structure the document (either in the issues list or in a pull request). Any other thoughts, then create an issue. 

## Github
- [Intro to Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) 
- [How to make your first contribution](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions). 
- [How to make your first contribution w/ Github desktop](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/gui-tool-tutorials/github-desktop-tutorial.md)

## Stata

## Python
- [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/). A website with many examples of economic models being solved with Python (and Julia too!).
- Cheetsheet by Quantecon for [Python](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/python-cheatsheet.html); [Python vs Matlab vs Julia](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/); [Stats: Python pandas vs Stata vs R](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/stats-cheatsheet.html).
- [Introduction to Scientific Computing with Python (CME 193)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cme193/syllabus.html). A one-unit course at Stanford -- worth taking at some point to see the full capacity of Python.  
- [Stata to Python Cheatsheet](http://www.danielmsullivan.com/pages/tutorial_stata_to_python.html


## Matlab
- [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/help/). A website that contains many solutions to any coding issues you may face on Matlab.

## Programming for economists
- [Code and Data for the Social Sciences:A Practitioner's Guide (Gentzkow,Shapiro)](http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf)
- [Course on computation (Fern√°ndez-Villaverde)](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/teaching.html)

## General programming
- [Toward Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/). Short articles on all things Python. Want to know how to use some of the packages listed above? There is bound to be an intro here.
