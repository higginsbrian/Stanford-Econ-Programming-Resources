# Crowd sourcing programming resouces for Stanford economists

This is a repo to crowdsource useful programming resources and to learn how to use GitHub in the process. If you want to add a link to the list, then please submit a pull request. You can also propose changes to how we structure the document (either in the issues list or in a pull request). Any other thoughts, then create an issue. 

## Github

- [How to make your first contribution](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions). 
- [How to make your first contribution w/ Github desktop](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/gui-tool-tutorials/github-desktop-tutorial.md)


## Stata
- [Using "inlist()"](https://twitter.com/nickchk/status/1295852192126005248?lang=en). A useful tool that will save you LOTS of time when defining variables.

## Python
- [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/). A website with many examples of economic models being solved with Python (and Julia too!).
