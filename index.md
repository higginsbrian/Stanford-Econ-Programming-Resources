# Crowd sourcing programming resouces for Stanford economists

This is a repo to crowdsource useful programming resources and to learn how to use GitHub in the process. If you want to add a link to the list, then please submit a pull request. You can also propose changes to how we structure the document (either in the issues list or in a pull request). Any other thoughts, then create an issue.
